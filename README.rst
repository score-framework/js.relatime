.. _js_relatime:

Lightweight humanized relative time formatting, inspired by Moment.js

Quickstart
==========

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="score.init.js"></script>
    <script src="score.relatime.js"></script>
    <script>
        score.relatime(new Date());
        // 'a few seconds ago';
        score.relatime("2015-10-21", "1985-10-25");
        // 'in 30 years';
        score.relatime("1955-11-12", "1985-10-25", {future: "Marty travelled %s back to the future"});
        // 'Marty travelled 30 years back to the future';
    </script>

Grammar
-------

An Object consisting of key/value pairs used to format the time span.

**default grammar**

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        future: 'in %s',
        past: '%s ago',
        s: 'a few seconds',
        ss: 'a few seconds',
        m: 'a minute',
        mm: '%d minutes',
        h: 'an hour',
        hh: '%d hours',
        d: 'a day',
        dd: '%d days',
        M: 'a month',
        MM: '%d months',
        y: 'a year',
        yy: '%d years'
    }

Negative time spans will use the ``past`` key, positive time spans the ``future`` key as the base string.

**changing the base string**

.. code-block:: javascript

    var grammar = {
       past: "Marty McFly arrived in the future %s ago",
       future: "Marty McFly will arrive in the future in %s"
    }

    score.relatime("2015-10-21", "2016-10-21", grammar);
    // "Marty McFly arrived in the future a year ago"

    score.relatime("2015-10-21", "2013-10-21", grammar);
    // "Marty McFly will arrive in the future in 2 years"

Grammars can be used for **i18n**:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var grammar = {
        future : 'in %s',
        past : 'vor %s',
        s : 'ein paar Sekunden',
        ss : 'ein paar Sekunden',
        m: 'einer Minute',
        mm : '%d Minuten',
        h: 'einer Stunde',
        hh : '%d Stunden',
        d: '%d Tag',
        dd: '%d Tagen',
        M: 'einem Monat',
        MM: '%d Monaten',
        y: 'einem Jahr',
        yy: '%d Jahren'
    };

    var localized = score.relatime.create(grammar);
    localized(new Date());
    // "vor ein paar Sekunden"



**Changing the base string from the localized function**

.. code-block:: javascript

    var variant = localized.create({past: "seit %s"});
    variant(new Date());
    // "seit ein paar Sekunden"

API
===

function ``score.relatime(date, relDate, grammar)``
    Returns a humanized string representation for the time span between a given
    *date* and the current time.

    The *date* can be an instance of ``Date()``, a timestamp or a
    string that will be parsed by the browser's native Date() function. But
    be careful, `cross-browser JavaScript Date parsing behavior
    <http://dygraphs.com/date-formats.html>`_ is an issue on older Browsers.

    The optional *relDate* accepts the same formats as *date* and will serve as
    the base date to compare the actual date to.

    It is also possible to override (parts of) the conversion strings by
    passing a *grammar* object. The expected format for this object can be
    found in the Grammar section, above.

function ``score.relatime.create(grammar)``
    Returns a new ``score.relatime`` function, bound to the given *grammar*.

    The expected format for the *grammar* argument can be found in the Grammar
    section, above.
